                <p>Hello and welcome to the Beginner's Guide of the UNIXverse! 
                Today we will cover useful features available in shell - 
                through the website content, talks and exercises (and 
                hopefully, by the time we finished this, with 
                <a href="solutions.html">solutions</a>.</p>
                
                <p>But first of all, what is shell? Many of you may think that 
                the terminal you use (xterm, terminator, etc.) is a shell - 
                you are partially right - it is an 
                <strong>interactive shell</strong>. A shell is basically an 
                interface that allows you to interact with a system's 
                interface. The reason terminals you are used to are 
                interactive is because you get to...well...interact 
                with it (you give it input, they give output/errors, you 
                give it more inputs [or rage quit].</p>
                
                <p>One important thing to note about shells is...well, 
                they are a "shell". All commands within a shell are 
                self-contained - this will be an important concept in 
                <a href="scripts.html">shell scripting</a>.</p>
            </div>
         
            
            <div>
                <div class="page-header">
                  <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-lg-12">
                      <h1 id="symbols">Cryptic Symbols</h1>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
                
                <p>When we are interacting with the terminal (or you are 
                viewing commands online), you commonly see symbols like 
                <code>$</code>, <code>~</code> and <code>%</code> (and most 
                probably a bunch of text) before commands. This is merely 
                to indicate that the command is entered by the user, and is 
                not the output of a program. Below is a demonstration of 
                what you may see.</p>
                
                <pre class="brush: bash;">
                # this is a comment
                $ echo "you may see it like this"
                you may see it like this
                Oliver $ echo "or like this, with Oliver in front"
                or like this, with Oliver in front
                Oliver % echo "or this"
                or this
                </pre>
                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    A common newbie mistake when using shell is to include the 
                    preceding text before commands when copying something from 
                    the shell. Please don't do this, as it only leads to 
                    confusing errors and CHAOS! Like that '$' just after 
                    Oliver, that's not a part of the echo command, so it 
                    shouldn't be copied.

                            <code>cd</code><br />
                            Stands for: Change Directory
                        </td>                        
                        <td>
                            A directory is the formal name 
                            for a folder. The first thing that you need to 
                            know about <code>cd</code> is that UNIX sorts 
                            directories in a hierarchy, which means that all 
                            files and directories have a 'parent' directory 
                            (the directory above the current one), and all
                            directories can have 'children', which are 
                            either files or directories.

                            <code>cd</code> is the tool used to change from one
                            directory to another. Think about this like the
                            folders in Windows Explorer - double-clicking on a 
                            folder opens it and shows its contents (its 
                            children).
                            
                            Examples:
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>cd ~</code> - takes you to your home 
                                    directory</li>
                                <li><code>cd folder</code> - if there is a 
                                    directory called "folder" in the current 
                                    directory, moves into that directory.</li>
                                <li><code>cd ..</code> - goes into the parent 
                                    folder.</li>
                                <li><code>cd /</code>, which goes to the root 
                                    directory. The root directory is the only 
                                    directory that doesn't have a parent. Every 
                                    directory and file in your file system is 
                                    therefore a child of the root directory, or 
                                    a grandchild, or ...</li>

                            <code>ls</code> provides just file and directory 
                            names, <code>ls -la</code> produces a vertical 
                            list with the details of all files, including 
                            hidden files. This can be incredibly useful!

                            <code>rm -r</code> <em>recursively</em> deletes
                            a folder, so it deletes all contents of the 
                            folder first, and then the folder itself.<br />
                            <code>rm -f</code> <em>force</em> the deletion 
                            of something.
                            <code>rm</code> can take multiple arguments,
                            so you can delete more than one thing at a time.<br />
                            For example: <code>rm file1 file2</code> will 
                            delete the files named "file1" and "file2".

                            arguments you give it to standard output (the 
                            screen), followed by a new line.<br />

                    If your arguments contains spaces, or special characters

                <p>Here are a few (useful) shortcuts to shell.</p>
                
                <h2>Reuse previous command</h2>
				<p>Hitting the "up" key will automatically place a previously
                executed command in your next command to execute. This works
                up until you reach the earliest point of history that the
                computer records.</p>
				
				<p>Going down, of course, does the opposite if you need it</p>

				<h2>Tab Completion</h2>
				<p>Essentially completes a command you have half-typed out so
                you don't have to waste precious milliseconds writing the 
                rest of it. It is literally magical.</p>

				<p>Mess around with the command above by making directories and
                navigating through them so you get used to it all. Make a folder
                with a really long name and then tab-complete the name when you
                <code>cd</code> into it. An example might be:</p>
                <pre class="brush: bash;">
                    mkdir antidisestablishmentarianism
                    cd anti&lt;tab&gt; &lt;enter&gt;
                </pre>
				<p>Try it, your life is now measurably better.</p>

                <p>This workshop sometimes relies on you knowing what the 
                standard streams are - standard input (<code>stdin</code>), 
                standard output (<code>stdout</code>) and standard error 
                (<code>stderr</code>). They are further described below:</p>
                
                <h2>Standard Input</h2>
                <p>This is where a program reads information from - input is 
                provided by the user, or by 
                <a href="#redirection">redirection</a>. It is also 
                known as <code>stdin</code>. C reads from stdin using  
                <code>scanf</code> in C, and Python uses 
                <code>raw_input()</code>.
                
                <h2>Standard Output</h2>
                <p>This is where data is usually printed out from a program. 
                This information is usually displayed in your terminal, 
                unless it is redirected. This is also known as 
                <code>stdout</code>. To print to stdout, C uses 
                <code>printf</code> in C, and Python uses
                <code>print</code>.</p>
                
                <h2>Standard Error</h2>
                <p>This is where errors are usually printed out from a
                program. It is also known as <code>stderr</code>. C prints to 
                stderr using <code>fprintf(STDERR, "");</code>, and Python
                prints to stderr using <code>sys.stderr.write</code>.</p>

            </div>
            
            <div>
                <div class="page-header">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-12">
                            <h1 id="redirection">Redirection</h1>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>You may sometimes want to change where the standard streams
                go or come from - for example, putting all messages printed to
                stderr into a file.</p>
                
                <h2>&lt;</h2>
                <p>Redirects the contents of a file into stdin, for a
                program to read. Example: <code>./program &lt;
                information.txt</code> pushes the contents of information.txt 
                into stdin, <code>program</code> to read.</p>
                
                <h2>&gt;</h2>
                <p>Redirects stdout from a program to a file. Example:
                <code>./program &gt; output.txt</code> puts the output of my
                program into output.txt.</p>
                
                <p>You can use <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to append to the end of a
                file, as <code>&gt;</code> rewrites the entire file.</p>
                
                <p>Note you can also combine redirectors: <code>./program &lt; in.txt &gt; out.txt</code>.</p>
                
                <div class="alert alert-info">
                    <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Note you can use
                    <code>&gt; /dev/null</code>, the "data sink", which is the 
                    equivalent of throwing output down the drain. This is 
                    useful for redirecting information that you don't want to
                    see without having to put that output into a file.
                </div>
                
                <h2>2&gt;</h2>
                <p>This does the same redirection, but for standard error. 
                For example, <code>./program 2&gt; errors.txt</code> logs 
                errors from the program into error.txt.</p>
                
                <p>You can redirect multiple output streams at once, but this
                can be messy and complicated. See <a
                href='http://www.unix.com/94627-post2.html?s=3cd64d8252501b9cb64647f0bad89c28'>this</a>

                <h2>|</h2>
                <p>This is a pipe, which takes the standard output of the left
                hand side of the pipe and "pipes" that output to standard input
                of the command on the right hand side of the pipe. This is very
                important in the next section, 
                <a href="filters.html">UNIX Filters</a>, and is the basis of 
                all commands. For example, <code>./program | ./program2</code> 
                puts all output of program 1 into program 2.</p>
                
                <p>Note all redirectors can be chained, for example, 
                <code>./program &lt; lol.txt | ./program2 | ./program3 &gt; out.txt</code>. 
                A chain of pipes is known as a pipeline.</p>

                    <h2>cat</h2>
                    <p>Takes unlimited arguments and outputs the contents of the
                    files to standard output. This way, the files are 
                    con<strong>cat</strong>enated together! For example, 
                    <code>cat a.txt b.txt</code> prints a.txt, then b.txt to 
                    standard output. This command can be useful for viewing a 
                    short file on screen temporarily.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you do not give it an argument, it'll wait for 
                    standard input from the user, followed by the end of file 
                    character (<code>CTRL+D</code>) and prints that out.</p>
                    
                    <h2>more and less</h2>
                    <p>More and less are both basic text viewers for terminal.
                    Less is better than more, but both are functional. You can
                    read and navigate a file by entering the command 
                    <code>less a.txt</code>. Less paginates output (displays it
                    one page at a time), which is a very welcome feature when
                    dealing with long files - you definitely do not what to 
                    simply <code>cat</code> a long file.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Text Editors</h2>
                    <p>There are many available on UNIX (some of which you 
                    have to install), including <code>gedit</code>, 
                    <code>emacs</code> and <code>vim</code>. What you use 
                    today is up to you!</p>
