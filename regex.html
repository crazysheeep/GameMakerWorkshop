                <p>Regular expressions are very useful for searching for 
                particular strings. For example, let's say that you have a

                you hate all Olivers in the world, and want to find out which 
                of your classmates has the name Oliver, so you can take their 
                lunch money. (This approach is a bit flawed, and taking 
                peoples' lunch money is mean, but no matter.)</p>

However, should we only search for a subsection of a name - for example, <code>liver</code> instead of <code>Oliver</code>, it will still return the same results. A string matches a regular expression if the expression is contained in the string.

                </div>
                In UNIX, we can use the <code>grep</code> utility to perform searches for lines matching a regular expression. The basic syntax we use is:
                <p><pre class="brush:bash; gutter:false">$ grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE]</pre></p>
                <p>We don't have to specify files for it to search against. We can omit the <code>[FILE]</code> option, or instead use a hyphen <code>-</code>. This tells <code>grep</code> to read from standard input. So we can specify a pattern, and then we will be prompted to enter input. After pressing the enter key, grep will print out that line again with matching parts highlighted if it matches the regex you specified.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>Let's return to our example of petty lunch-money-stealing. This time, we'll get <code>grep</code> to do our pattern matching for us. Download the names <a href="./names">here</a>, and save them into a folder you can easily access. Next, open up a terminal (if you don't have one open already) and navigate to the folder containing the file you just downloaded. Now, it's time to enter our command. Our pattern is <code>Oliver</code>, and the file we want to search through is called <code>names</code>. This should be fairly self explanatory:</p>
                        <pre class="brush:bash; gutter:false">$ grep Oliver names</pre>
                        <p>Enter the command. </p>
                        <p>The terminal should give you back results exactly identical to those identified earlier with the same pattern (unless this content's writer is lacking in the head). Note that <code>grep</code> highlights the matching part of the string:</p>
                        <pre>$ grep Oliver names
<strong style="color:red">Oliver</strong> Fan
<strong style="color:red">Oliver</strong> Thanh
<strong style="color:red">Oliver</strong> Petrol</pre>
                        <p>This comes in extremely handy when trying to figure out what's wrong with a pattern that isn't working.</p>
                        <p>If you like, you can add extra names to the <code>names</code> file and verify that <code>grep</code> is indeed working and isn't merely fluking it. You can also change the pattern used and see what output you get!</p>

You can use UNIX filters, although in this case it's clearly not very efficient: <code>cat names | grep Oliver</code>. In this case, the contents of <code>names</code> are being sent to standard output, and piped into <code>grep</code>. Since we haven't specified a file for <code>grep</code> to use, it uses the provided text from standard input - in this case, whatever's in <code>names</code>.

                        <p>Now that <code>grep</code> and friends have been introduced, let's get into the meatiness of regex. In this section, basic expressions for patterns will be introduced. Throughout this lesson, we'll be using <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code>, a file of around 100000 words, to test out our regex patterns.</p>
                        <p>First and foremost, the most intuitive part of regex is that a letter will only match itself. Naturally, if we specify a pattern <code>a</code>, it will match the letter <code>a</code>. If we have a pattern <code>aa</code>, it will match anything containing <code>aa</code>, and so on. This should be highly intuitive.</p>

                        <p>A character matching against itself is all well and good, but leaves a little to be desired. What if you don't care about what a particular character is? Well, happily, there's also a character for that. The <code>.</code> (a full stop) character will match any character. So the pattern <code>.</code> will match any word you compare against it - it matches lines with at least one character in it.</p>
                        


                        <p>Next up are some quantifiers. Quantifiers specify how many of a particular character/group are to be matched.</p>

If we do not enclose the pattern in quotes, then the shell will attempt to interpolate variables and special shell metacharacters will be interpreted. This can have interesting (read: frustrating) effects when using these special characters.</p>
                            <p>If we enclose the pattern in single quotes - <code>'I love the $north'</code>, the shell will not touch the pattern. If we enclose it in double quotes - <code>"I love the $north"</code>, the shell will attempt to replace variables (in shell, variables begin with $ when being referenced. In this case, $north will be replaced by its respective value).</p>

                </div>
                <p>Now we'll introduce some extremely useful metacharacters - the <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> characters. The caret (<code>^</code>) specifies that whatever follows it <em>must</em> be at the start of the line. So for example, if we wanted to <em>ensure</em> that we search for Oliver as a first name only, then we have the pattern as</p>
                <pre class="brush:bash; gutter:false">$ grep "^Oliver" names</pre>
                <p>The dollar sign (<code>$</code>), in a similar fashion to the caret, specifies that whatever comes before it must be at the end of the word. So if we wanted to only accept lines that had "Oliver" in them, then we would use the command</p>
                <pre class="brush:bash; gutter:false">$ grep "^Oliver$" names</pre>
                <p>(In either of these cases, we didn't need to wrap quotes around the pattern, but it's good practice to just in case your pattern does have characters that can be interpreted by the shell.)</p>
                <p>Let's look at at a couple of examples of anchor usage. Let's say that we want to look for all words that begin with a, end with z, and have at least one character in between them. Then the pattern we'd use would be - (note the <code>-E</code> flag, since we're using an extended regex character)</p>
                <pre class="brush:bash; gutter:false">$ grep -E "^a.+z$" /usr/share/dict/words
abuzz
adz
                </pre>
                <p>Let's modify our pattern a bit, then. Maybe if we change it to end in y we'd get more results.</p>
                <pre class="brush:bash; gutter:false">$ grep -E "^a.+y$" /usr/share/dict/words
abbey
ability
abjectly
ably
abnormality
...                </pre>
                <p>Woo, that worked! Now let's do a search for words that start with "capt" and end in "ing" (or you can pick a different combination, if you like). Hopefully the pattern here should be obvious:</p>
                <pre class="brush:bash; gutter:false">$ grep -E "^capt.+ing$" /usr/share/dict/words
captaining
captioning
captivating
capturing</pre>
                <p>Hopefully, you should get the same results as we did here.</p>

                </div>
                <p>What's a bracket expression?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's denoted by [<em>list of characters</em>]</li>
                    <li>It will match any single character from the list of characters.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For example, <code>[aeiou]</code> will match any vowel.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>You might think that, then, in order to get (for example) the numbers zero to nine, you'd have to go <code>[0123456789]</code> in your pattern. But luckily, there's a nice shorthand for ranges of characters like these - <code>[0-9]</code>. Similarly, you can also use <code>[a-z]</code>, <code>[A-Z]</code> or even <code>[a-m]</code> or another section of the alphabet or numbers. You can even chain them together like <code>[a-zA-Z0-9]</code> - this will match any alphanumeric number.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, you might want to match any character <em>except</em> anything that's in the list. That's fine! Simply add a <code>^</code> after the first bracket. For example, if I wanted to exclude all the numbers then I would use <code>[^0-9]</code>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4">

                            <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> <strong>Note: </strong>One useful range you could use is <code>[ -~]</code> - this will match any printable character.

                        <h1>
                            Regex Behaviour
                        </h1>
                    </div>
                    <p>Regex behaves in a certain way, and it would be of benefit to you to learn how it does.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong><em>Me first: </em></strong>If a pattern can match multiple parts of the input, then the first match will be chosen. For example if you had a pattern <code>[0-9]+</code> and a string of <code>1234 5678</code>, then it would match the <code>1234</code> and not the <code>5678</code>.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>Greedyguts: </em></strong>By default, regex is <em>greedy</em>. This means that it will try to match as much of the string as possible. Note that with the example in the previous point that it matched as much of it as it could - so, <code>1234</code> instead of <code>1</code>. Simplying matching the <code>1</code> would have been <em>non-greedy</em>. If we wanted a particular quantifier to be non-greedy, we just need to put a question mark after it. So for the previous example, we would have the pattern <code>[0-9]+?</code> and this would match only the <code>1</code>.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>The great escape: </em></strong>Sometimes, you probably won't want the special meaning of <code>[</code>, <code>]</code> or any other special character - you'll want to search for it literally. In this case, you preface the character with a backslash:</p>

                    <pre class="brush:bash">$ echo "[]" > example
$ cat example
[]
$ grep "[]" example
grep: Unmatched [ or [^
$ grep "\[\]" example
[]
                    </pre>
                    <p>As you can see, searching for the square brackets on their own isn't going to do you any good. However, escaping the respective brackets tells <code>grep</code> to search for a bracket literal. This is the reason why our earlier command <code>grep $ name</code> wasn't very useful.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <div class="page-header">

                            The Stream Editor - <code>sed</code>
                        </h1>
                    </div> 
                    <p>So we know about the data streams, <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code>, and now we knwo about the basics of regular expressions and how one can single out peices of data from larger bodies of data. <code>sed</code> is another filter, like the ones we looked at before and it does exactly as it says, it edits the the stream of data. What makes <code>sed</code> special is it can use regex like <code>grep</code> can to single out bits of data in the <code>stdin</code> stream and then it can replace that singled out data with whatever it wants, using regex again if need be.</p>
                    <p>
                        Here are some examples of <code>sed</code> syntax:
                        <pre class="brush:bash">
sed -e 'EditCommands' DataFile
sed -f EditCommandFile DataFile

                        </pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <em>EditCommands</em> section inside the quotes is where all the magic goes on. The two main commands you'll be using with sed will be the replace commands:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>s/RegExp/Replace/</code> - Substitute first occurrence of string matching <em>RegExp</em> with Replace string.</li>
                            <li><code>s/RegExp/Replace/g</code> - Substitute all occurrences of string matching <em>RegExp</em> with Replace string.</li>
                        </ul>
                        But there are also other options you can add to the Edit Commands:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>p</code> - Print the current line.</li>
                            <li><code>d</code> - Delete (don't print) the current line.</li>
                            <li><code>/RegExp/</code> - Selects all lines that match <em>RegExp</em>.</li>
                            <li><code>/RegExp1/,/RegExp2/</code> - Selects all lines between lines matching reg exps.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Here are some examples of <code>sed</code> usage:
                        <pre class="brush:bash">
# print only lines containing 'xyz'
sed -n -e '/xyz/p' &lt; file

# print only lines not containing 'xyz'
sed -e '/xyz/d' &lt; file

# show the passwd file, displaying only the
# lines from "root" up to "nobody" (i.e. system accounts)
sed -n -e '/^root/,/^nobody/p' /etc/passwd
 
# remove first column from ':'-separated file
sed -e 's/[^:]*://' datafile

# reverse the order of the first two columns
sed -e 's/\([^:]*\):\([^:]*\):\(.*\)$/\2:\1:\3/'
                        </pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>That last example touches on a feature present in most implementations of regular expression, <code>()</code> groupings and then the variables <code>\1, \2</code> that correspond to the contents of their respective brackets the the matching regex.</p>
                    <p>It might sound a bit confusing but it will make more sense in practise and if you're too confused about it ask a helper or one of the teachers about it. :)</p>

Use a grep pattern anchored at both ends, that matches exactly 9 characters of any kind. Redirect the output of the command using the &gt; shell notation. How many of these words are there?</p>
                            <p>Now we want to use the list of words as a (huge) search pattern. fgrep uses a highly optimised algorithm to do this. Its usage is:</p>

fgrep -f WordListFile files...
</pre>
                            <p>However, we aren't interested in words that have any non-letter in them, to avoid matching possessives like Bernouilli's. We also don't want to match lines that are exactly 9 characters long either.</p>
                            <p>
                            <p><strong>Devise</strong> a pipeline that uses your word list (words9) and the original file to count the number of words composed of letters only that have a different 9-letter word as a substring. For example "luminesce" is a substring of "photoluminescence".</p>
                            <p>Note there are a small number of non-English words in the dictionary which have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritical marks</a> which are encoded as a separate character in ASCII - your regular expressions don't need to handle these correctly.</p>

                                <p>This can't be done with a (true) regular expression. You prove this via the the wonderfully named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_regular_languages">pumping lemma</a>.</p>
                                <p>It is possible <a href="http://faq.perl.org/perlfaq6.html#Can_I_use_Perl_regulextension"> with extensions to the regular expression language provided in languages such as Perl </a>.</p>
